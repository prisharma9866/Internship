                <p class="para para1">I successfully completed a 4-week virtual internship in Web Development with CodSoft from July 5th, 2024, to August 5th, 2024. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on several web development projects, where I was able to apply and further enhance my coding and design skills.
                 My contributions were recognized with wonderful remarks, as I was able to:<br>
                 1. Deliver high-quality work that met project requirements.<br>
                 2.Showcase strong problem-solving abilities.<br>
                 This experience not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of communication and teamwork in a 
                remote setting. I am eager to apply the knowlege and gained experience from this internship to future projects.</p>
